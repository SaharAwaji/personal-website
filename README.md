Hello, I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida studying data science. I have worked on many data science and data analytics projects, all of which are summarized in my `CV <link_to_your_cv>`_. Summarized results of select journal papers, conference proceedings, hackathons, and personal projects are located in `projects <link_to_your_projects>`_. For a more up-to-date list of my publications, see my `Google Scholar <link_to_your_google_scholar>`_.

Here's my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sahar-awaji-phd-a82537b1/; let's connect!

An ongoing goal of mine is to capture some notes from my PhD and other studies. An abridged version of my PhD notes is captured in `notes <link_to_your_notes>`_, which will continue to grow as I find time to transcribe them! The notes are a concatenation of lecture notes and online resources. I try to cite resources as often as I can but do not always.

This website was built to be a portfolio for others to see; however, perhaps more importantly, it functions as a platform for me to keep track of previous projects and my ongoing notes.
